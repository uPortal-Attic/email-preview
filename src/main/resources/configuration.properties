##### CAS Configurations only [used only on casContext.xml - see it for advanced configurations]
### so actually you don't need to adjust any properties below if you don't use CAS on email-preview
### to fix CAS setup - don't hesitate to modify logback.xml to have more logs around CAS

# server name used by user to access to the portal [https://portal.jasig.org for example]
# "serviceUrl" CAS parameter will be ${cas-config.serviceServerName}/${cas-config.emailpreviewContext}"
cas-config.serviceServerName=${environment.build.uportal.protocol}://${environment.build.uportal.server}

# cas-config.serverName  - the server name of the server this application is hosted on 
# take care : on loadbalancing context, that can be like https://portal2.jasig.org
cas-config.serverName=${environment.build.uportal.protocol}://${environment.build.real.uportal.server}

# email-preview context - usually email-preview
cas-config.emailpreviewContext=email-preview

# cas server url - the cas server [https://cas.jasig.org for example]
cas-config.casServerUrl=${environment.build.cas.protocol}://${environment.build.cas.server}/${environment.build.cas.context}

# CAS imap/pop serviceUrl used in the Proxy CAS configuration on the imap/pop server side
cas-config.serviceUrl=imap://imap-ent.giprecia.net
